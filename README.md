- 👋 Hi, I’m @pyer-coder on GitHub.
- 💤 I've taken a major break from my previous intense coding period to focus on other hobbies and life
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development and some game development (nothing too complicated)
- 💞️ I love programming and the combination of creativity and logic
- 🌱 I started many years ago, as a young child, entering the world of coding, and immediately thinking I know everything
- 😬 I'm in the midst of the world of coding, and know I know nothing
- 🤦‍♂️ I've got a book full of ideas, and code/wireframes ready to be expanded uopn, that will likely never achieve their potential glory
